# Exploring-Music-through-Textual-insights
The goal of the Project is to employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the relationships between musical genres, artists,and how popular their songs are among users' sentiments. Finding similar themes and emotions linked to songs or genres is the goal, as it makes it possible to identify well-known musicians, the songs that people like the most, and the songs that are less well-liked or popular.
The dataset is taken from Kaggle and is divided into two subsets: one with song lyrics (links, lyrics, names, and language) and the other with artist information (artist ID, songs, popularity, and links).
Genres: Hip pop, Rock, Pop, Pop/Rock, Rap, Romantico, Axe, Reggaeâ€¦etc
